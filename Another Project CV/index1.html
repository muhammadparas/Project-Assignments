			<h2>Let there be stories...</h2>
			<p>Life is a cold winter month in Antartica, and there is plenty of sins around. And still several months until spring. But it is also a time when the day gets longer and when the life can create beautiful days. </p>

		<h2>Whom Am I</h2>
		<p>Pursuing study in bachelor in computer science graduate with a 3.3(CGPA) from the University of Punjab,Jhelum Campus, currrently being in the 5th semester looking to secure a position to use and further develop my analytical skills and knowledge in a practical and fast-paced environment to help your organization grow nationally as well as at international level.</p>

		<h3>What do I do</h3>
		<p>TI did not want to study CS but I had no choice. So i try to gain my interest in this field. But sometime i think its too late. May its not. I am not sure. So the question Who am I does nothing than bring sorrow and regret. We are running towards life and success but none of us has found their puspose. We are here for a purpose. Allah made us. He made nothing insignificant. Even a fly has its purpose and insects too who keep our eco system going on. So I believe that we are different and each of us has a purpose.
		Some time i write stories and try to be creative just to get away from this world. </p>
